    <h2><a href="../homepage/homepage.html">Homepage</a></h2>
    <li>When preparing what kind of semantics I would use for the Homepage,
     I looked at what needed to be most visible. What do I want the user
        to catch on. I used semantics such as Article for the main content,
     and all of the content are in figures to give the user a better
     understanding of the content. To emphasize that the quote from 
        Hotel California is a quote I used the "blockquote" tag so that 
     even machines can read it.  All of the pictures use has 
        an "alt" tag to describe what the picture consists of, and 
        since some of the pictures have an amusing undertone, I 
        tried to match that with the description.  Most of 
        my semantic use is based on the principles that you should be able to 
        enjoy the website, even if your own eyes can´t see it. 
     Therefor I see the Homepage code as universally accessable, based on my use of HTML elements.

    <h3><a href="../CV/CV.html">Resume/CV page</a></h3>
    <li>
      We used "html lang="en""" to set the language to English, because it is
       the world’s lingua franca.  Below "head" we used "link rel="stylesheet" href="CV1.css""
        to create a connection to the CSS-file. Then we added "title" CV page "/title",
         so that the visitors will get a general perception of what this page is about.
         Furthermore, inside the "body" tag, we used "a href="”>" to create a link 
         to his email. As for the "h2" tags, we thought it would create better structure
         of the content. Additionally, by adding "b" tags to them, the headlines would 
         stand out in the page. We have also added ID- and class attributes in case we
         wanted to add any CSS-elements to it later in the process. To create some 
         variation, we minimized the font-size at the top of the page in the CSS-file
       with the attribute “font-size”, and  changed the font-type with “font-family”.
         In order to insert a picture, we used "figure" and "img" with a src-attribute
       so that the file could know where to find the picture. Additionally, we used 
       width- and height attributes to adjust the picture.
         Finally, by using "ul", followed by "li" we could structure the content 
         lucidly and tidily.

    <h4><a href="../Portfolio/Portfolio/portfolioIndex.html">Portfolio page</a></h4>
    <li>
      Inn Jason portfolio, the important semantic tags we used was "strong", "cite" and "figure" elements. 
      The portfolio purpose is to show Jason best work and projects to future employees.
      The best way to show it to the users is through picture, texts and styling and to achieve
      this is to code and use the HTML elements to describe the content of the page. Inn the start
      of all the projects-box description, we emphasize the years Jason acted in his works or project
      to make it readable for the reader how recent or relevant his project was. The song Chandelier
      by music artist Sia was defined as a work from a music artist and we used the semantic tag "cite"
    for exactly that definition. Inn this page was a picture we needed to define that had a text belonging
     together. That texts were also a quote from a movie where we used the element "blockquote".
      The "figure" element was used here for the purpose of connecting the text and picture as one object. 
      By setting the texts (with the "figurecaption" that tells it is a caption for the picture) and image in
    this tag, the machine will see the quote is related to the picture. The other pictures were not 
    defined by the "figure" element because we thought it was not necessary to use it and it didn´t work
     with how we wanted to style the content.</li>
